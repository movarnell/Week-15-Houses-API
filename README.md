The code submitted is a React-based web application for managing a list of houses and their rooms. It consists of multiple components including HousesList, House, and NewRoomForm. The HousesList component fetches house data from an API and renders each house as a House component. The House component renders the house name, a list of its rooms, and a form for adding new rooms. The NewRoomForm component contains input fields for entering a new room's name and area, and a button to submit the form. The application also includes a HousesApi class for communicating with the API, and an App component that renders the HousesList component. Overall, the code represents a basic but functional interface for managing house and room data.
